# The Council of Rules

The Council of Rules strives to do a few things.

1. Create a set of rules to follow.
2. Uphold those rules upon eachother, ourselves, and our orginization.
3. Improve and revise these rules.
4. Avoid being in the news.
5. Operate entirely within the law.
6. Be able to operate anonymously.
7. Be able to protect and conceil our rules at any time.
8. Be mysteryous, but make our rules clear.

Thus, our mission is clear.

As of writing this document, the starting rules have yet to be published.
